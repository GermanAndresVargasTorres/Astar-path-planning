This Webots project simulates path planning for a mobile robot using an A* search algorithm. Planning is implemented using Python and is carried out by an overseer agent, which then communicates motion commands to the robot, whose controller is implemented using C. For more details, please read the corresponding [simulation results paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/329684570_Simulation_of_e-puck_path_planning_in_webots).

To interact with the simulation, you must install Webots and perform the following steps:

1. Download all repository files.
2. In Webots, choose the "Open project" option and choose the "mundo_webots.wbt" file located in the "worlds" folder.
3. Start and control the simulation using Webots' controls.
